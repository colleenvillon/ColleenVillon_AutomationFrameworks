Hi there! 👋 👋 👋  

👀 I’m Colleen V. Villon and I am a Software Developer In Test (SDET)
🌱 I love to code and automate things so I decided to put here all my projects that I've worked on. From TDD to BDD and other frameworks that I've created.
💞️ If you have something to automate or test, feel free to contact me. 
📫 If you want to connect with me, you can email me at colleen.villon@gmail.com
